## Recorded Audio

[OboeTester](README.md) can record audio.
The data is only used to test the audio recording capability of your device.
These tests include:

* measuring round-trip audio latency
* measuring glitches by listening to an output sine wave
* recording audio for immediate playback and listening

Audio recording is always initiated by a button press.

It is possible for you, the user, to share WAV files that have been recorded.
You can email them to someone, or upload them to Google Drive, or send them to other Sharing destinations.
This is optional. No recorded audio is uploaded or saved by the program unless the user requests it.

## Phone State

OboeTester can also check and modify the phone state. This is only used for testing modes like "Speaker Phone" or turning on or off Bluetooth SCO.

## Test Results

The user can ask OboeTester to run automated tests that look for audio bugs or measure performance.
These generate reports that contain the results of the test plus information about the phone including:

* manufacturer (eg. Samsung)
* model (eg. S10)
* version and build information (eg. Pie 9.0)
* audio performance metrics (eg. latency, glitch rate)
* audio feature support (eg. AAudio MMAP)

But you, the user, can can email them to someone, or upload them to Google Drive, or send them to other Sharing destinations.
This is optional. No reports are uploaded or saved by the program unless the user requests it.
