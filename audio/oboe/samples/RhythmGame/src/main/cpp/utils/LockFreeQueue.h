/**
 * A lock-free queue for single consumer, single producer. Not thread-safe when using multiple
 * consumers or producers.
 *
 * Example code:
 *
 * LockFreeQueue<int, 1024> myQueue;
 * int value = 123;
 * myQueue.push(value);
 * myQueue.pop(value);
 *
 * @tparam T - The item type
 * @tparam CAPACITY - Maximum number of items which can be held in the queue. Must be a power of 2.
 * Must be less than the maximum value permissible in INDEX_TYPE
 * @tparam INDEX_TYPE - The internal index type, defaults to uint32_t. Changing this will affect
 * the maximum capacity. Included for ease of unit testing because testing queue lengths of
 * UINT32_MAX can be time consuming and is not always possible.

     * We have 2 counters: readCounter and writeCounter. Each will increment until it reaches
     * INDEX_TYPE_MAX, then wrap to zero. Unsigned integer overflow is defined behaviour in C++.
     *
     * Each time we need to access our data array we call mask() which gives us the index into the
     * array. This approach avoids having a "dead item" in the buffer to distinguish between full
     * and empty states. It also allows us to have a size() method which is easily calculated.
     *
     * IMPORTANT: This implementation is only thread-safe with a single reader thread and a single
     * writer thread. Have more than one of either will result in Bad Thingsâ„¢.
